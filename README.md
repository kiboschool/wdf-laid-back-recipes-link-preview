# Add Link Previews

The Laid Back Recipes site is almost complete! It just needs nice link previews, so that it shows up nicely in search and when shared on social media.

## Instructions

Edit index.html to make the site more suitable for sharing.

* Edit the `<title>` tag
* Add a favicon (you can get an image of the beach emoji from [favicon.ico](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/beach-with-umbrella/))
* Add a meta tag for the description
* Add `og:` meta tags for the type, url, title, description, and image

You can use any of the images for your image preview - choose which one you like best!

If you want to control how the site looks when shared on twitter, add the `twitter:` meta tags too.

You can use [Metatags.io](https://metatags.io/) to generate the meta tags, then copy and paste them into `index.html`. Be sure to update the image urls to the urls from your site, instead of the `metatags.io/assets` urls.

Test out your metatags by copying the Replit url and pasting into the meta tag tester on [opengraph.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz/).
